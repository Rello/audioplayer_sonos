            ‚ö†Ô∏è  This is the most important part of the report ‚ö†Ô∏è
            Without a way to easily reproduce your issue, there is little chance we will be able to help you and work on a fix.
            Please, take the time to show us some code and/or config that is needed for others to reproduce the problem easily.
            Most of the time, creating a "bug reproducer" as explained in the URL below is the best way to help us
            and increases the chances someone will have a look at it:
